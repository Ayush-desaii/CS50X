## Lessons Learned

part of a snake game where i have to increase the size of the snake( to make it longer after eating food) was a bit difficult. i got many errors but finally did it using array. i counted the pieces of the snake and stored the first heads x and y posion in array and then passed it to the next piece whene head is updated with new positions of x and y.
